# Step by step guide
Here, we will go through every detail behind the various scripts step by step. In summary, there are four main steps here:

1. Theoretical prediction,
2. Generate meshes and convert their format,
3. Run FEM simulations on the meshes,
4. Analyse the data generated by the FEM simulations. 

In order to be able to conduct these steps, you must have installed the two conda environments "*fenicsproject*" and "*gmsh\_latest\_version*" (see the file with local path "../README.md"). Other than that, you must have installed Python as well as the two Python libraries *numpy* and *matplotlib*.  

# 1. Theoretical prediction
We will consider the following parameters of the Schnakenberg model: (a,b,gamma,d)=((0.20,1.00,20.00,6.87). These parameters isolate the eigenmode n=1. 

Interestingly, Bandle et al. [1] have derived a theoretical formula for how the perturbed eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator is affected when a hole is added on the south pole. To plot the perturbed eigenvalues as a function of the radius of the hole, run the following script:<br>

*python find\_parameters\_and\_plot\_perturbed\_eigenvalues.py*

. Then, the figure below will be generated.

What this figure tells us is there is always at least one eigenvalue corresponding to n=1 the intervall indicated by the dashed lines denoted by M and L. In turn, this leads to the following rather striking conclusion: *the patterns are unaffected by the introduction of hole in the sphere*. 

Next, we wish to validate this theoretical prediction by running FEM simulations. In order to be able to run these simulations, we first need to generate some meshes of spheres which have a hole of varying size located at the south pole.
 
# 2. Generate meshes and convert their format
If you look into the folder with path "../Meshes" you see that it is empty with the exception of the README.md file. To this end, we want to fill this folder with numerous meshes so that we can run FEM simulations on these meshes. Concretely, we want to do two things:

1. Generate meshes of numerous spheres with a single hole located at the south pole using Gmsh,
2. Convert the format of these meshes so that they can be read by FEniCS.

## 2.1 Generate meshes of numerous spheres with a single hole located at the south pole using Gmsh,



## 2.2 Convert the format of these meshes so that they can be read by FEniCS.

# 3. Run FEM simulations on the meshes


# 4. Analyse the data generated by the FEM simulations
