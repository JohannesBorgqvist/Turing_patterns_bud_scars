The inputs are the vector itself called epsilon and the parameter sigma determining the variance of the standard normal distribution from which the perturbations of the steady states in the initial conditions are drawn.

The initial conditions for the two states in the Schnackenberg are set two a small perturbation around the steady state. The perturbation is given by a normal distribution with zero mean and where the variance is determined by the input sigma. Hence, no output is returned and the following input must be provided:
# 1. The Hilbert space H,
# 2. The mesh stored in the variable mesh,
# 3. The mesh function mf_subdomains indicating the subdomains in the mesh,
# 4. The number of holes on the sphere stored in num_holes,
# 5. The steady states of the Schnackenberg model stored in steady_states,
# 6. The variance of the perturbation determined by sigma,
# 7. The FEM function on the function space H stored in U in which we set the initial conditions.

def initial_conditions_Schnackenberg_sphere_with_holes(H,mesh,mf_subdomains,num_holes,steady_states,sigma,U):
    #----------------------------------------------------------------
    # DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE FUNCTION DOES
    # We assign the following initial conditions to the sphere:
    #1. u(t=0,*)=u0+epsilon
    #2. v(t=0,*)=v0+epsilon
    # where u0 and v0 are the provided steady states stored in the list steady_states and epsilon is a normally distributed variable that is drawn from the standard normal distribution with variance determined by the input sigma. If the mesh has a hole in it we set the initial condition u(t=0,x)=v(t=0,x)=0 for all spatial coordinates x in the hole. We use this solution as the hole is implemented as a sub-region in the mesh at hand.
    # In order to access the three different parts of the mesh (i.e the hole, adjacent region to the hole and the rest of the sphere) the so called dof_map of dolfin is used. This map enumerates all nodes in the mesh. Also, the provided mesh funcion in mf_subdomains keeps track of the various subdomains of the mesh which enable us to categorise all nodes as either "on the rest of the sphere" so to speak or "in the hole". Using the list of these nodes we are able to set the initial conditions properly by assigning values to the provided function U which is a vector valued function containing both states u and v in the Schnackenberg model.

# Function 6: "gradient_sphere"
# The function is a help function for the Function 8 called "" and it defines the normal direction on the sphere. Now, given a state w (that is the concentration profile of either u or v in the Schnackenberg model) and the mesh the function return the normal direction. This is necessary in order to calculate the integrals giving rise the elements in the stiffness matrix (i.e. the terms associated with diffusion in the VF).

# Function 7: "VF_and_FEM_Schnackenberg_sphere_with_holes"
# The function calculates the matrices in the FEM formulation by
# defining the variational formulation and projecting it onto the
# space of continuous picewise linear bases functions over the mesh.
# The function takes the following inputs:
# 1. The list parameters containing the parameters of the Schnackenberg model,
# 2. u and v being the states of the Schnackenberg model,
# 3. phi_1 and phi_2 being the trial functions,
# 4. U_prev being the solution at the previous time step,
# 5. dx_list containing the integration measures needed in order to define the variational formulation,
# 6. mesh containing the FEM-mesh of the sphere with a hole (potentially),
# 7. activation_parameters containing the factors with which the reaction terms are increased or decreased in the region adjacent to the hole.
# The function returns the following output:
# 1. The mass_matrix in the LHS of the matrix equation resulting from FEM,
# 2.The stiffness_matrix in the LHS of the matrix equation resulting from FEM,
# 3.The reaction_matrix in the LHS of the matrix equation resulting from FEM,
# 4. The mass_load_vector_rhs in the RHS of the matrix equation resulting from FEM,
# 5.The stiffness_load_vector_rhs in the RHS of the matrix equation resulting from FEM,
# 6.The reaction_load_vector_rhs in the RHS of the matrix equation resulting from FEM.
