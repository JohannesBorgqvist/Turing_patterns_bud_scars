When all simulations have been launched (see the file "../STEP\_BY\_STEP\_GUIDE.md" for details), the resulting data files are stored in subfolders in this folder. The names of these subfolders contain all the information that characterises the particular simulation that was launched. For example, the data files that are stored in the subfolder that is named as follows:<br>

*h\_0\_a\_0p2\_b\_1p0\_d\_20p0\_gamma\_6p873\_sigma\_0p0001\_T\_50\_ICs\_around\_steady\_states*<br>

correspond to a simulation on the hole without a hole ("h\_0"), the parameters of the corresponding simulations were (a,b,d,gamma)=(0.2,1.0,20.0,6.873), the perturbation of the steady state concentrations which determined the initial conditions were characterised by sigma=0.0001, the final time point of the simulation was chosen to T=50, and the initial conditions of these simulations were chosen so that the concentration profile of both states in each node of the mesh were set to the respective steady state concentration plus a small perturbation determined by sigma. 

Another typical file name:<br>
