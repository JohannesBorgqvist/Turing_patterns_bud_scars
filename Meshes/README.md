# The meshes

All the meshes generated by Gmsh are stored here with the suffix ".msh". All the meshes that are converted by FEniCS, or [DOLFIN](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1731022.1731030) if you want to be precise, are also stored here with the suffices ".h5" and ".xdmf". It is the latter of these two formats that FEniCS can read.
