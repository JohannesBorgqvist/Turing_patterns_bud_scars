## Working with branches
We have one main branch and two additional individual branches. All the work that should be done individually should be managed on the two individual branches called "Johannes\_branch" and "Philips\_branch" respectively. All the work that has been done in parallel should then be merged to the main branch. A good rule of thumb is that *no work is done on the main branch*, and we only merge to this branch. However, there are two important exceptions to this rule:

1. The README.md file should only be changed on the main branch,
2. The TASK_LIST.md file should only be changed on the main branch as well. 

Here is a good guide on *how to work with branches* ([see the following link](https://thenewstack.io/dont-mess-with-the-master-working-with-branches-in-git-and-github/)).
